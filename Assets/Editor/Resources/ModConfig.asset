  description: "Have you ever been wondering whose [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801400247]Mod
    Selector[/url] profile let that module appear on the bomb, or just want to know
    which of your experts can help you with it? This mod will give you the answers
    without leaving the game.\r\n\r\nHighlight (but do not select) any module for
    a few seconds, or press F1 while it is highlighted or selected, and the mod will
    show the following:\r\n* All active expert profiles which enable the module\r\n*
    All active expert profiles which disable the module\r\n* All inactive defuser
    profiles which would veto the module\r\n* When using Dynamic Mission Generator
    profile pools, which profile the module was chosen from\r\n\r\nThe key mentioned
    above and the delay before the overlay appears can be configured. There is also
    an option to show the module's name, but using this will disable submitting leaderboard
    entries.\r\n\r\nWhen using motion controls in VR, instead highlight any highlightable
    part of a module and press the grip button on a Steam VR controller, or the B
    or Y button on an Oculus Touch controller. Press the button again with nothing
    highlighted to hide the popup.\r\n"
